## VIPER

VIPER is an acronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. It is an architectural design pattern that promotes separation of concerns and modular development in iOS application development. Here's a brief explanation of each component in VIPER:

View: The View layer is responsible for presenting the user interface (UI) and handling user interactions. It receives input from the user and sends it to the Presenter for processing.

Interactor: The Interactor contains the business logic and serves as the bridge between the Presenter and the data layer. It performs tasks such as data fetching, processing, and manipulation. The Interactor receives requests from the Presenter and returns the results asynchronously.

Presenter: The Presenter acts as the intermediary between the View and the Interactor. It receives user input from the View, processes it by interacting with the Interactor, and prepares the data to be displayed by the View. The Presenter is also responsible for updating the UI based on the results received from the Interactor.

Entity: The Entity represents the application's data model or domain model. It encapsulates the data and defines the business logic related to that data. The Entity is independent of the VIPER architecture and can be reused across multiple modules.

Router: The Router handles the navigation and routing logic within the application. It is responsible for presenting or dismissing screens and coordinating the flow between different modules or components of the application.

The VIPER architecture promotes a modular and scalable approach to iOS development by clearly separating responsibilities and dependencies between components. It enhances testability, maintainability, and code reusability. Each component in VIPER has a specific role and follows a unidirectional flow of data, contributing to a more structured and organized codebase.
